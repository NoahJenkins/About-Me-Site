- An interactive tool to generate CSS gradients by selecting two colors. The generated CSS is displayed and applied to the background in real-time.

#### How It Works
1. The user selects two colors using color input fields.
2. JavaScript captures the selected colors and generates a CSS linear gradient.
3. The generated CSS gradient is displayed in a `<code>` element.
4. The background of the section is updated in real-time to reflect the selected gradient.
